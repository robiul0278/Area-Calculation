            <h1 class="font-bold">(1) What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
            <p> <span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic. The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes.</p>
            
            <br> <br> 
            <h1 class="font-bold">(2)) How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1> 
            <p><span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> The word DOM stands for Document Object Model, where a web page is called a Document, and all tags inside the document are an object and the tree structure of every object the model. </p>

            <br> <br>
            <h1 class="font-bold">(3)) What is event bubble?</h1>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> Event bubbling in JavaScript can be defined as the method by which an event which got triggered within a nested set of HTML elements gets captured by the innermost element and travels up the DOM tree hierarchy to its outermost element</p>

            <br> <br>
            <h1 class="font-bold">(4)) What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> Callbacks are asynchronous functions which are executed when an event occurs. They are triggered automatically when some event occurs. When you setup a callback, you are just telling JS that call this function when some event occurs.</p>
